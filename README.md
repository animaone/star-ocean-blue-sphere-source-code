## This repository contains an extracted source code from the Gameboy Color game Star Ocean Blue Sphere, the extraction was done automatically using my own dynamic disassembler

### I am currently documenting this source code manually.
### The percentage % of code documented (code and variables) actually is: ![36%](https://progress-bar.dev/30)

## Current state of the disassembler:

## 2020 version released!

### sobs_new/ <- 2020 version


### Facts about Star Ocean Blue Sphere and the current stage of the disassembler:

 - ~= 70000 Lines of **assembly** source code
 - Programmed by 3 persons: 
   - Teruki Okusi
   - Naohisa Kamei
   - Natsuki Nishimura
 - Yeah. I know a game is not made only by the programmers, there are game designers, graphic artists, musicians, salesperson, logistics specialists, marketing, but... I still am amazed that this game was created by a so small quantity of ninjas, many thanks for this piece of art.

# Building:
TO COMPILE: EXECUTE ./sobs_new/buildRom.sh -> you will need wla-gb to compile. wla-gb version used: wla-gb 9.11a

# Symbols File:
There is a symbols file that can be used for documenting/debugging purposes: Asmrom.sym https://github.com/animaone/star-ocean-blue-sphere-source-code/blob/master/asmRom.sym

Symbols files are supported in the following emulators: BGB and GearBoy



# Previous source code version:
old version for historical purposes (check old source code branch here: https://github.com/animaone/star-ocean-blue-sphere-source-code/tree/old_version)


# If you have documented any part of the source code, please provide a symbols file so that we can grow the documentation, which is not possible to be done in an automated way.
